 # Description of the Project 
 
 A layer 2 dividend and stocks distribution solution over a decentralized network using EIP1973

 # Problem specification related to ERC 1973

 Corporate scams have always been the talk of town as it was quite possible before Blockchain to successfully mutate the data and make a fraud happen. Rich could easily stop other rich people from growing and this mostly happens due to mutable records and cheating.

 # Solution in relation to ERC 1973 
Sound application of ERC 1973 allows ERC20 reward distribution in a scalable manner to all the partcipating nodes. 
Blockchain is moving from cryptos to other sides of applications now. With the introduction of tokens one can dissolve shares as security tokens and can share dividends or profits using the EIP1973 rewards distribution mechanism.
ERC1973 allows dynamically sharing the profits/rewards, and this helps such a platform to function on Blockchain. Such design allows shareholders to buy and sell shares at any point in time.


A corporate company issues 25 shares every 6 months. A company gives tokens in the form of rewards to the share buyer and it depends on number of shares an individiual buyers.
With that token buyer can get shares at discounted price and it depends on number tokens they have.


company issues shares every 6 months->number of share holders -> dividend sharing among investors

1. 6 months -> 25 shareholders -> 100/25 - 4% profit to each shareholders
2. 12 months -> 50 shareholders -> 100/50 - 2% profit to each shareholders
3. 18 months -> 75 shareholders -> 100/75 - 1.33% profit to each shareholders
4. 24 months -> 100 shareholders -> 100/100 - 1% profit to each shareholders
5. 30 months -> 125 shareholders -> 100/125 - 0.8% profit to each shareholders
